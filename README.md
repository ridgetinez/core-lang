# BUILDING A FUNCTIONAL COMPILER :: CORE #

---

How the hell was a committee language like Haskell even made? I have no idea, but it's pretty good news when one of its founding members, Simon Peyton Jones, wrote a lab manual on the implementation of a functional compiler for the Core Language back in the 1980s. The aim of this project is to work through the ton of projects in his paper in Haskell and to unlock that sweet treasure trove of information in compiler study.
